The project served under the MIT License with the exception of usage of the logo.
A logo that includes artistic or design elements, (i.e. not just the name on its own), 
is legally regarded as being a work of artistic creation and therefore will be protected 
under copyright law.

Copyright protects the logo as an artistic work. As copyright is an automatic 
international right, it therefore follows that, (other than activities specified 
under fair dealing rules), unauthorised copying of that logo would be an infringement.
